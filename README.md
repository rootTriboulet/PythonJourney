# PythonJourney

This is my personal journey of learning Python — step by step, project by project.  
I’m diving into how Python is used in the world of cybersecurity: from simple scripts to automation, hacking tools, and everything in between.  

I’ll be posting my progress, notes, and small projects as I get better at coding and problem-solving.  
It’s all about learning, experimenting, and having fun while exploring how powerful Python can be.
