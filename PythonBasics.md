# Learning Python — TryHackMe Room

### Date: October 11, 2025  
### Platform: [TryHackMe — Python Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/pythonbasics)

---

## Objective
To build a strong foundation in Python, focusing on concepts that are useful for cybersecurity — automation, scripting, and logical thinking.

## What I Learned

During this room, I covered Python fundamentals step-by-step, understanding how the language can be used to create small yet powerful programs.  
Here’s what I practiced and learned:

- How to **print text and display information**
- Performing **mathematical operations**
- Working with **variables** and **data types**
- Using **logical** and **boolean operators**
- Writing **if statements** to control program flow
- Understanding **loops** (`for`, `while`) and how they automate tasks
- Creating **functions** for reusable code
- Reading and writing **files**
- Using **imports** to add external Python libraries

I also practiced by solving small math problems and writing short, fun programs to apply each concept.

## Reflection

Learning Python through TryHackMe made me realize how programming directly connects to cybersecurity.  
Every script can automate a small part of a bigger process — whether it’s scanning, data collection, or analysis.  

By completing this module, I not only learned Python syntax, but also developed the mindset to think like a problem-solver — a skill I’ll keep improving as I move into networking and penetration testing topics.
